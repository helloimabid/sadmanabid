  longBio: `I'm Sadman Abid, a tech enthusiast who started my journey as a passionate web developer, creating responsive and user-friendly web applications. Over time, my curiosity about how systems work under the hood and how business efficiency can be increased by processing data interested me in studying cybersecurity as well as data analytics.

My background in web development gave me a solid understanding of how digital platforms work but I was ready to transition from building them to securing and optimizing them. Nowadays, I focus on uncovering vulnerabilities, understanding the internal mechanics of computer systems, and using data analysis to derive insights that identify problems, improve efficiency, and recommend solutions of businesses.`,
